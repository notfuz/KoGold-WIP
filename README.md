# Finally Updated :D

# KoGold WIP
Hey fellow koronian! Welcome to my github!
This is a themed based extension with a custom CSS editor and the ability for you to make ur own custom themes.
At the moment there are only a few base themes but there will be more to come.
More options other than theming is coming like my old Banned Account Viewer and some other stuff that never made it to github.
I am planning on mergin an existing trading extention made by arz (owner of koromons). If you found any bugs please contact me on discord, my username is notfuz.
